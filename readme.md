The _Magical GCD_ of a nonempty sequence of positive integers is defined as the product of its length and the greatest common divisor of all its elements.

Given a sequence (a<sub>1</sub>, ... , a<sub>n</sub>), find the largest possible Magical GCD of its connected subsequences.

## Input

The first line of input contains the number of test cases _**T**_ The descriptions of the test cases follow:

The description of each test case starts with a line containing a single integer _**n, 1 ≤ n ≤ 100000**_. The next line contains the sequence _**a<sub>1</sub>,a<sub>2</sub>,…,a<sub>n</sub>, 1≤a<sub>i</sub>≤10<sup>12</sup>**_..


## Output

For each test case output one line containing a single integer: the largest Magical GCD of a connected subsequence of the input sequence.
